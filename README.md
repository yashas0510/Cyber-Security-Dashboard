# Overview
The Cyber Security Breaches Dashboard is an interactive Power BI project that provides comprehensive insights into cybersecurity breaches. By visualizing historical and current breach data, the dashboard enables organizations to better understand their exposure to cyber threats, track incidents over time, and implement more effective security measures. This project aims to enhance awareness of cybersecurity issues and promote informed decision-making.

What is Cyber Security?
Cyber Security encompasses the practices, technologies, and processes designed to protect computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. As digital transformation accelerates, organizations face an increasing number of cyber threats. Effective cybersecurity strategies are essential for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining trust with stakeholders.
Use Case
This dashboard is designed for:
Security Analysts: To monitor and analyze breach incidents.
IT Managers: To assess the effectiveness of current security measures.
Executives: To understand the organizational risk landscape and allocate resources accordingly.
Compliance Officers: To ensure adherence to regulatory requirements regarding data protection.
Features
Interactive Visualizations: Engaging charts and graphs that allow users to explore data intuitively.
Real-time Updates: The ability to refresh data to reflect the most current breach information.
Custom Filters: Users can filter data by various parameters such as date range, type of breach, industry sector, and geographic location.
Detailed Drill-downs: Capability to dive deeper into specific incidents for thorough analysis.
Export Options: Users can export reports in various formats (PDF, Excel) for presentations or further analysis.

Dashboard Components
Visualizations
The dashboard consists of several key visual components:
Breach Trends Over Time: A line chart showing the number of breaches reported over a specified period.
Current Open Breaches: A card visualization displaying the total number of ongoing breaches that require attention.
Types of Breaches: A pie chart categorizing breaches by type (e.g., phishing, ransomware).
Affected Employees: A bar chart illustrating how many employees were impacted by breaches across different departments or sectors.
Filters and Interactivity
The dashboard includes various filters that enhance user interaction:
Date Range Selector: Users can specify a start and end date to filter breaches within that timeframe.
Breach Type Filter: Allows users to focus on specific types of breaches (e.g., data theft, malware).
Industry Sector Filter: Users can filter data based on different industries affected by breaches.
Data Sources
The dashboard utilizes datasets from reputable sources such as:
Publicly available breach databases (e.g., Privacy Rights Clearinghouse).
Industry reports on cybersecurity incidents (e.g., Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report).
Ensure that you have permission to use any datasets included in this project.
Usage Scenarios
Here are some practical scenarios for using this dashboard:
Incident Response Planning: Security teams can analyze past breaches to identify patterns and improve incident response strategies.
Risk Assessment: Executives can use insights from the dashboard to evaluate organizational vulnerabilities and prioritize investments in cybersecurity.
Training Needs Assessment: HR departments can identify areas where employee training may be necessary based on types of breaches affecting their organization.
